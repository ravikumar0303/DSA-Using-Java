Drawback of static stack :
As we have used array, the stack becomes of fixed size, it cannot grow or
shrink during execution time (runtime).

To avoid this dynamic stack is used (linked list).


----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic stack :
--- stack is implemented using linked list (generally using singly linked list).
--- In dynamic stack there is not stack full condition (upper limit is ram capacity).
--- In this the elements are physically deleted from the memory.


Node definition : (same as Node of SLL)
