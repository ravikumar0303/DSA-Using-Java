Applications of linked list :

1. To implement another types of data structures for storing the data.
   -- dynamic stack
   -- dynamic queue
   -- tree structured data -- organization structure
   -- graph data --- google map
2. To store the polynomials 
   polynomical contains terms added together and each term is made of two 
   parts - coefficient and variable(s).  There can be one or more than one 
   variables in the term and each variable has a power value.
   Polynomials are writtern in the descending order of power's of variables
   For e.g.^
   one variable polynomial ---  3x^5 - 5x^3 + 10x^2 - 55x + 4
   two variable polynomial ---  45x^5y^3  + 12x^3y^6 - 45y

3. To store the linked data
