--- We can enqueue or dequeue the elements from both ends.
---Means - enqueue can be done at front as well as rear end.
         - dequeue can be done from front as well as rear end.
--- So here, two types of enqueue() and dequeue() operations -
    a) enqueue_at_rear() : same as normal enqueue().
    b) enqueue_at_front() : new operation.
    c) dequeue_from_front() : same as normal dequeue().
    d) dequeue_from_rear() : new operation.












MCQ :
In case deque (double ended queue), which are the new operations to be added
with the operations performed in other types of queues?
Ans :  enqueue_at_front() and dequeue_from_rear()

There are two types of double ended queues :
1. Entry (insert) restricted double ended queue :
   --- dequeue operation can be done at both ends
   --- but enqueue will be done only at one end (mostly at rear end).

2. Exit (delete) restricted double ended queue :
   --- enqueue operation can be done at both ends
   --- but dequeue will be done only fron one end (and mostly at front end).
