
Drawback of array : 

1. Every array is of fixed size (whether the memory is allocated during 
   compile time or runtime).  It cannot grow or shrink during program 
   execution.
2. It requires contiguous memory locations.
3. Insertions and deletions are not possible / complicated in array.

For e.g. 
int arr[50];  // c lang  compile time ---- stack memory

 
// c++ 
int n;
cin >> n;
int arr1[]=new int[n];  // runtime   ---- heap memory

We cannot change the memory size of arr or arr1 once it is allocated.

--- To remove the drawbacks of array, linked list data structure is used.

Linked list : A linked list is an ordered collection of data elements
which are stored at random memory locations and linked to one another.

--- It is linear data structure -- elements are having one-to-one relationship
    among themselves.
--- It is dynamic (no fixed size) in nature --- it can grow or shrink during run-time.
--- The elements in linked list are accessed sequentially.
--- Elements are arranged in linked organization inside the computer's memory
    at random locations.

As LL is a data structure, we should able to define triplet - D,F,A

For e.g. suppose we are maintaining the chain of person

Data object : person

Functions :
1. create a chain (LL)
2. insert at front 
3. insert at end
4. insert in between
5. insert at position
6. insert in sorted order
7. delete from front
8. delete from end
9. delete from in between
10. delete by position
11. delete by value
12. traversal (visit every person) - forward, backward
13. Search
14. Sort

Axioms : 
1. We need to maintain the reference of starting point (element) and/or ending point.
2. Elements must be linked with each other.


Types of linked list : broadly two types - linear and circular which is again
categorized into two types - singly and doubly
1. Linear singly linked list (SLL)
2. Circular singly linked list (CSLL)
3. Linear doubly linked list (DLL)
4. Circular doubly linked list (CDLL)
