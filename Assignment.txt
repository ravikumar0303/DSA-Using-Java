Assignment 1

1. Write a Java program to find the index of an array element.
2. You will be given an array and you need to find the third largest 

3. You are given array consisting of n integers. Your task is to find the maximum length of an increasing subarray of the given array.

A subarray is the sequence of consecutive elements of the array. Subarray is called increasing if each element of this subarray strictly greater than previous.
i/p-5 1  7  2  11  15
o/p -3

Rearrange Everything
Given an array of size n where all elements are in range from 0 to n-1, change contents of arr[] so that arr[i] = j is changed to arr[j] = 	.
i/p - 22   13 9 41
o/p  - 22  9  13  41
